Advent of Code Solutions
========================

I previously uploaded these as separate repositories. I may continue to do that, but there is some value of having them all in one place, even if it's using the submodule feature.  I've removed most of the puzzle inputs from this repository to focus mainly on solutions, however, the inputs are automatically downloaded when run with the correct `.aocinfo`/`aocinfo` file corresponding to your user session key.

I may back and properly link some of the other repos and remove duplicate code. I won't go back to clean up any of these solutions, and some of the mini-rewrites I had to do to get some of them solved. I think it's a decent thing to leave in for demonstration puposes.
